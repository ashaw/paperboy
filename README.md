# paperboy

Use chartbeat's historical API to get popular stories over any time period. Look at those stories' META tags to get context and weed out dead links. Package stories into neat HTML files. Ideal for morning emails. Works with [chartbeat.gem](http://github.com/ashaw/chartbeat) and [stats_combiner.gem](http://github.com/tpm/stats_combiner) (for data filtering).
